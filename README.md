# My Java Learning Journey ðŸš€

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the repository where I'm documenting my progress and studies in the Java programming language.

This space serves as my personal logbook as I navigate the fundamentals of Java, from the very basics to more complex concepts. All the code you find here is related to the exercises and challenges from the course I'm currently taking.

## ðŸ“š About the Course

I'm learning Java through the **Java 10x** course, created by **HorÃ¡cio Muller (aka Fiasco)**. It's a comprehensive program designed to build a strong foundation in Java development.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

To keep things organized, this repository is structured into folders. Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or module from the course, making it easy to track the learning path.

## ðŸ’» Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Java (OpenJDK 23)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Learning

My main goal with this repository is to practice and solidify my understanding of core Java concepts, including:

* Basic Syntax and Variables
* Control Flow (if/else, switch, loops)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
* Classes, Objects, and Methods
* Data Structures (Arrays, Lists, etc.)
* And much more as I advance through the course!

## ðŸ”— Connect with Me

Feel free to explore the code. As I'm on a learning path, any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
